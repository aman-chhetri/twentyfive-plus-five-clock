# 25 + 5 Clock 🕒

The 25 + 5 Clock application provides a customizable timer that alternates between two user-defined intervals: a work period of 25 minutes and a break period of 5 minutes. This project aims to provide an efficient and intuitive way to manage time through the popular technique of the Pomodoro method.
